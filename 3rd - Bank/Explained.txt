1. The program defines a smart contract named SimpleBank in Solidity.

2. It uses a mapping to store each user’s wallet address and their Ether balance.

3. The deposit() function is payable, which means it can receive Ether.
- When a user deposits, the Ether value (msg.value) is added to their balance.

4. The withdraw() function lets users withdraw Ether.
- It uses require() to check if the balance is sufficient.
- If yes, Ether is sent to the user using transfer(), and balance is updated.

5. The showBalance() function is a view function that simply returns the user’s current balance.
6. This contract shows how to handle deposits, withdrawals, and balances securely using mappings and payable functions.



                                                    
mapping(address => uint)          - Used to store each user’s wallet address with their balance. 
               
deposit()                         - Payable function — allows users to send Ether and adds it to their balance. 

withdraw()                        - Lets users withdraw Ether if they have enough balance.                      

require()                         - Checks condition (like balance) and stops function if false.      
          
transfer()                        - Sends Ether safely from contract to user’s wallet.                         
 
showBalance()                     - Returns the current Ether balance of the user.                        
      
msg.sender                        - The address of the user who called the function.                     
       
msg.value                         - The amount of Ether sent with the transaction.                      
        
payable keyword                   - Allows a function or address to receive Ether.                        
      
view keyword                      - Means the function only reads data — doesn’t modify blockchain.
