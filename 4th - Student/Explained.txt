1. The program defines a smart contract named StudentData in Solidity.

2. It uses a structure (struct) to store details like roll number, name, age, and course.

3. A dynamic array of students is declared to store multiple student records.

this code is about storing and managing student information using Solidity.
It uses a structure to hold details like roll number, name, age, and course,
and a dynamic array to store multiple student records.
The addStudent function adds new students,
the getStudent function retrieves a student’s details by index,
and totalStudents shows how many students are stored.
It also includes fallback and receive functions to handle accidental Ether transfers safely.
This program demonstrates how to use structures, arrays, and fallback functions in a smart contract.”




struct Student               - Groups related student details like roll, name, age, course.   

Student[] students           - Dynamic array to store multiple student records.               

addStudent()                 - Adds a new student to the array using push().                  

getStudent()                 - Displays student details by index number.                      

require()                    - Ensures index is valid before accessing data.                  

totalStudents()              - Returns total number of students stored.                       

fallback()                   - Handles unknown function calls or wrong data safely.           

receive()                    - Handles direct Ether transfers to the contract.                

memory keyword               - Stores temporary data in memory while executing.               

private keyword             - Hides the array so it can’t be accessed directly from outside.
